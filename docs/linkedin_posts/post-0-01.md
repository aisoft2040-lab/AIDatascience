Today I started a 3-week prelearning plan for the AI Engineer 5‑month challenge. Focus: Python basics (loops/functions), Git, and SQL queries on Kaggle dataset.

Key code:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hi, {name}!"

print(greet('World'))
```

More: see `notebooks/python-ml-basics.ipynb` in the repo.
