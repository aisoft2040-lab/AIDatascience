# Week 1: Introduction to LLM APIs & Prompt Engineering

## 📋 Overview

**Focus Area**: Basic LLM integration, prompt design, and cost tracking

**Learning Objectives**:
- Make API calls to OpenAI and other LLM providers
- Understand API parameters and their effects
- Design effective prompts for various tasks
- Track token usage and costs
- Handle errors and rate limits

**Prerequisites**:
- Completed Getting Started Guide
- Python development environment set up
- OpenAI API key configured

## 🎯 Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**: Chatbot that maintains conversation context
2. **Quality**: >90% of responses are relevant and helpful
3. **Cost**: Average cost per conversation under $0.05
4. **Safety**: Input validation and basic content filtering

## 🛠️ Deliverable: Production-Ready Chatbot

Build a chatbot application with:
- Conversation history management
- Cost tracking per conversation
- Multiple prompt strategies
- Error handling and retry logic
- Basic safety features

## 📊 Implementation Notes

This week focuses on:
1. Making your first LLM API calls
2. Understanding token counting and costs
3. Managing conversation context
4. Handling errors gracefully
5. Basic input validation
